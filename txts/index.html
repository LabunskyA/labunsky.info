    <h2 id="a-spy-authentication-protocol">A spy authentication protocol</h2>
<p>So, we're sending super-secret under-cover agents Alice and Bob to the country of an opposing side. According to their mission they will need to contact and work with each other for some time, exchange some info, usual spies stuff. Of course, everything should be done with all possible security in mind.</p>
<p>After all, we don't want a disclosure: it threatens not only agents themselves but the very national security. That's why in our interest to provide them with minimal required information. In particular, less they knows about each other and communication methods the better. But then how should they authorise each other?</p>
<p>TL;DR - inventing authentication steganography-based technique for an imaginable three-letters agency.</p>

<h2 id="a-covert-channel-over-not-only-the-telegram">A covert channel over (not only) the Telegram</h2>
<p>We used to think of Telegram as a reliable and secure transmission medium for messages of any sort. But under the hood, it has a rather common combination of a- and symmetric encryptions. Where’s fun in that? And why would anyone trust their messages to the third-party anyway?</p>
<p>TL;DR — inventing a private covert channel over users blocking each other.</p>

<h2 id="about-a-strange-data-copression-method">About a strange data copression method</h2>
<p>Another user tries to write a new data piece to his hard drive, but there is no space left for it. He also refuses to delete anything since ‘he will need it later’. What should we do with it?</p>
<p>This problem is not a unique one. We have terabytes of data laying somewhere on our hard drives, and it is not going to shrink any time soon. But how unique is it? At last, every file is just a bit sequence, and it is probable, a new one not all that different from already stored ones.</p>
<p>Sure, you should not search for existing pieces of data on a hard drive — if it is not a predictable failure, it is not practical at least. On the other hand, if the difference is not that great, maybe we can somehow fit one into the another…</p>
<p>TL;DR — trying to tell about strange data storage optimization technique using JPEG-files and F5 steganography algorithm.</p>
