Graduated from [Saratov State University](https://www.sgu.ru/en) after five and a half years of education as an [ISCED level 7](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf) Information Security Specialist. My fields of research are mostly somewhere around steganography and applications, excessive data protection techniques, decentralized protocols, and effective programming.

I can read, speak and code freely in C, C++ Java, JavaScript (both client and server sides) and Python. Capable of understanding and using some other languages, like Assembly, Go, Bash and more high-level languages with reference and a bit of practice. Do believe in my knowledge on complex algorithms and data structures. Other programming-related skills include but not limited to: working with crypto-currencies, with databases using little or no-SQL, writing effective multi-threaded applications and a passion to optimize things no one cared about.

Currently self-employed trading commodity futures at [MOEX](https://www.moex.com). 3 years of trading, 5 years of software engeneering experience and counting. You can try to hire me, if you want to.

Do not smoke and do not care about others smoking, but do occasionally drink a little alcohol. Enjoy running, roller skating, cycling and other physical activities as much as solving hard problems. Do not really care about money, status, fashion and other social leveling stuff.
