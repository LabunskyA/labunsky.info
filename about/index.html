My fields of research are mostly somewhere around steganography and applications, excessive data protection techniques, decentralized protocols, and effective programming.</p> <p>I can read, speak and code freely in C, C++ Java, JavaScript (both client and server sides) and Python. Capable of understanding and using some other languages, like Assembly, Go, Bash and more high-level languages with reference and a bit of practice. Do believe in my knowledge on complex algorithms and data structures. Other programming-related skills include but not limited to: working with crypto-currencies, with databases using little or no-SQL, writing effective multi-threaded applications and a passion to optimize things no one cared about.</p> <p>Currently self-employed trading commodity futures at <a href=https://www.moex.com>MOEX</a>. 3 years of trading, 5 years of software engeneering experience and counting. You can try to hire me, if you want to.</p> <p>Do not smoke and do not care about others smoking, but do occasionally drink a little alcohol. Enjoy running, roller skating, cycling and other physical activities as much as solving hard problems. Do not really care about money, status, fashion and other social leveling stuff.</p> </div> <div class=footer>made from scratch by me</div> </body> </html>
