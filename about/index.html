    <p>Graduated from <a href="https://www.sgu.ru/en">Saratov State University</a> after five and a half years of education as an <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf">ISCED level 7</a> Information Security Specialist. My fields of research are mostly somewhere around steganography and applications, excessive data protection techniques, decentralized protocols, and effective programming.</p>
<p>I can read, speak and code freely in C, C++ Java, JavaScript (both client and server sides) and Python. Capable of understanding and using some other languages, like Assembly, Go, Bash and more high-level languages with reference and a bit of practice. Do believe in my knowledge on complex algorithms and data structures. Other programming-related skills include but not limited to: working with crypto-currencies, with databases using little or no-SQL, writing effective multi-threaded applications and a passion to optimize things no one cared about.</p>
<p>Currently self-employed trading commodity futures at <a href="https://www.moex.com">MOEX</a>. 3 years of trading, 5 years of software engeneering experience and counting. You can try to hire me, if you want to.</p>
<p>Do not smoke and do not care about others smoking, but do occasionally drink a little alcohol. Enjoy running, roller skating, cycling and other physical activities as much as solving hard problems. Do not really care about money, status, fashion and other social leveling stuff.</p>
