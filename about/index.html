    <p>This is more an informal about page. If you are looking for something more structured and CV-like, you need to look <a href="cv">there</a>. No, really, I will be glad to be hired.</p>
<p>My name is Labunsky Artem. I am a XY years old man living in a Russian province so, before anyone asks, I do enjoy reading Marx and dreaming about the world communistic revolution. Do not smoke and do not care about others smoking. But do occasionally drink a little alcohol myself.</p>
<p>Graduated from Saratov State University after 5.5 years of education as an <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf">ISCED level 7</a> Information Security Specialist. My fields of research are mostly somewhere around steganography and applications, excessive data protection techniques, decentralized protocols, and effective programming.</p>
<p>I can read, speak and code freely in C, Java, JavaScript (both client and server sides) and Python. Can understand and use some other languages, like Assembly, C++, Python, Go, Bash and more high-level languages with reference and a bit of practice. Do believe in my knowledge on complex algorithms and data structures (can remove an element from a B-tree after waking up in the middle of a night). Other programming skills include but not limited to: working with crypto-currencies, with databases using little or no-SQL, writing effective multi-threaded applications and a passion to optimize code no one cared about.</p>
<p>Made incredible percentages on crypto-currencies (liked them before the hype) and lost most of the profit trading stocks (you don't want to buy KHC at $80+ now, do you?), futures and options. Pros: now I can resist pretty much any levels of stress and know how the financial world is working with all that fancy economics.</p>
<p>Enjoy roller skating, running and other physical activities as much as solving hard problems. Do not really care about money, status, fashion and other social leveling stuff.</p>
