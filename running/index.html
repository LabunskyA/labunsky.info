Information about them? Not so much. You can find a few reviews on different Internet resources, but for how many? My guess would be 40%. At best. And not even half on them about the consumer oriented shoes. <em>Then how one should chose, which pair to buy?</em></p> <p>Imagine <em>breaking up a shoe into its parts</em>. You would get an upper, a midsole and an outsole consisting from different elements depending on the model. If one would know everything about each part, would they be able to determine <em>if the shoe is good</em>. That's why I'm creating a library of every tech component in running shoes I own or tested.</p> <h2>Brand it</h2> <p>Every company is trying to find its niche and constantly evolving to make us pay for a new pair of shoes. The results differ a lot even when some brand tries to copy the other one. So much there is little point comparing them. </p> <p>That's why I decided to write about every single one separately:</p> <ul> <li><a href=adidas>Adidas</a> - invented Ultraboost and of most the running shoes on the planet;</li> <li><a href=nike>Nike</a> - heavily marketed and consumer-oriented rival with sub 2 hour marathon record;</li> <li><a href=reebok>Reebok</a> - one of the most innovative midsoles for an average Joe;</li> <li><a href=puma>Puma</a> - very different glance at the running shoes with crazy style and R&D;</li> <li><a href=skechers>Skechers</a> - my favorite brand with an amazing price/quality performance;</li> <li><a href=ua>Under Armour</a> - one of the best soles to date.
