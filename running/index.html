            <h1>Running, Shoes and the Tech</h1>
<p>There are a lot of running shoes in the market. Information about them? Not so much. You can find a few reviews on different Internet resources, but for how many? My guess would be 40%. At best. And not even half on them about the consumer oriented shoes. <em>Then how one should chose, which pair to buy?</em></p>
<p>Imagine <em>breaking up a shoe into its parts</em>. You would get an upper, a midsole and an outsole consisting from different elements depending on the model. If one would know everything about each part, would they be able to determine <em>if the shoe is good</em>. That's why I'm creating a library of every tech component in running shoes I own or tested.</p>
<h2>Brand it</h2>
<p>Every company is trying to find its niche and constantly evolving to make us pay for a new pair of shoes. The results differ a lot even when some brand tries to copy the other one. So much there is little point comparing them. </p>
<p>That's why I decided to write about every single one separately:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="adidas">Adidas</a> - invented Ultraboost and of most the running shoes on the planet;</li>
<li><a href="nike">Nike</a> - heavily marketed and consumer-oriented rival with sub 2 hour marathon record;</li>
<li><a href="reebok">Reebok</a> - one of the most innovative midsoles for an average Joe;</li>
<li><a href="puma">Puma</a> - very different glance at the running shoes with crazy style and R&D;</li>
<li><a href="skechers">Skechers</a> - my favorite brand with an amazing price/quality performance;</li>
<li><a href="ua">Under Armour</a> - one of the best soles to date. And they are smart!</li>
<li><a href="asics">Asics</a> - an oldscooler trying to innovate;</li>
<li><a href="newton">Newton</a> - the most weird and satisfying to run in shoes you could possibly find;</li>
<li><a href="decathlon">Kiprun / Kalenji / Evadict</a> - Decathlon brands trying to keep up with the competition.</li>
</ul>
