# Running, Shoes and the Tech

There are a lot of running shoes in the market. Information about them? Not so much. You can find a few reviews on different Internet resources, but for how many? My guess would be 40%. At best. And not even half on them about the consumer oriented shoes. *Then how one should chose, which pair to buy?*

Imagine *breaking up a shoe into its parts*. You would get an upper, a midsole and an outsole consisting from different elements depending on the model. If one would know everything about each part, would they be able to determine *if the shoe is good*. That's why I'm creating a library of every tech component in running shoes I own or tested.

## Brand it

Every company is trying to find its niche and constantly evolving to make us pay for a new pair of shoes. The results differ a lot even when some brand tries to copy the other one. So much there is little point comparing them. 

That's why I decided to write about every single one separately:

- [Adidas](adidas) - invented Ultraboost and of most the running shoes on the planet;
- [Nike](nike) - heavily marketed and consumer-oriented rival with sub 2 hour marathon record;
- [Reebok](reebok) - one of the most innovative midsoles for an average Joe;
- [Puma](puma) - very different glance at the running shoes with crazy style and R&D;
- [Skechers](skechers) - my favorite brand with an amazing price/quality performance;
- [Under Armour](ua) - one of the best soles to date. And they are smart!
- [Asics](asics) - an oldscooler trying to innovate;
- [Newton](newton) - the most weird and satisfying to run in shoes you could possibly find;
- [Kiprun / Kalenji / Evadict](decathlon) - Decathlon brands trying to keep up with the competition.
