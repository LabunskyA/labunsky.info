# Running, Shoes and the Tech

I love running. Trying to do at least 5 km/day, everyday. Love going fast, love going slow. And, of course, I love doing it with maximum comfort and performance for the feet and the lowest draw from the wallet. Love good running shoes.

Too bad for me, I guess. There are some good resources with shoe reviews, opinions and basic technical info, but only about the most well known flagship models. It's cool to have hundreds of reviews on Vaporfly or Ultraboost, but how many consumer-oriented models are left behind? And how can we identify if they are good or not?

Well, I have an idea. I would try running in different shoes and write... no, not about them, but their parts and technology used to create them. That way you can analyze running shoes by their components (which are easy to see) and decide if they are good for you even with literally no reviews available.

## Brand it

Creating running shoes is a very competitive business. Every company is trying to find its niche and constantly evolving to make us pay for a new pair of shoes. The results differ a lot even when some brand tries to copy the other one. So much there is little point comparing them. 

That's why I decided to write about every single one separately:

- [Adidas](adidas) - invented Ultraboost and of most the running shoes on the planet;
- [Nike](nike) - heavily marketed and consumer-oriented rival with sub 2 hour marathon record;
- [Reebok](reebok) - one of the most innovative midsoles for an average Joe;
- [Puma](puma) - very different glance at the running shoes with crazy style and R&D;
- [Skechers](skechers) - my favorite brand with an amazing price/quality performance;
- [Under Armour](ua) - one of the best soles to date. And they are smart!
- [Asics](asics) - an oldscooler trying to innovate;
- [Newton](newton) - the most weird and satisfying to run in shoes you could possibly find;
- [Kiprun / Kalenji / Evadict](decathlon) - Decathlon brands trying to keep up with the competition.
