            <h1>Reebok</h1>
<p>What if you would take Adidas engineers and let them do whatever they want to? And also make shoes cheaper?</p>
<p>You would get simple, but nice shoes for everyday use. Propulsion plates? Don't need 'em. Branded tire-level outsoles? You are not a car, why bother. Whyle we're at it, forget all the fancy upper materials. We only got one and will never put it in our running shoes anyway. Also, less diversified and smaller shoe range. 8-10mm drop everywhere. The only flat worth $250 and will make you cry because of its durability. But a lot of value on consumer models. </p>
<p>Only Reebok can sell you Pebax midsole for as low as $50 on a clearance. And they will go even lower with their TPU models. That's 2-8 times lower than the competitors. </p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Floatride</strong> - Pebax foam, best price/quality midsole material there is;</li>
<li><strong>Floatride Energy</strong> - eTPU (Boost-like) midsole for everyday use;</li>
<li><strong>Flashrim</strong> - pure TPU undervalued midsole;</li>
<li><strong>ZIG</strong> - more of a lifestyle EVA in a zig-zag pattern;</li>
<li><strong>Liquifect</strong> - gel (think Asics) under a regular EVA;</li>
<li><strong>FuelFoam</strong> - base EVA midsole material with nothing fancy in it;</li>
<li><strong>Flexweave</strong> - upper material to withstand anything being cool and light at the same time. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Shoes to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Floatride Energy</strong> - best everyday shoe you can buy under a $70;</li>
<li><strong>Floatride Run Fast</strong> - the most affordable Pebax midsole in the world;</li>
<li><strong>Speed TR Flexweave</strong> - not a running model officially, but a great flat nevertheless.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>Good prices, especially on clearances;</li>
<li>$$$ tech at a way lower price range;</li>
<li>Suitable for any kind of runner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blown rubber in outsoles is not great traction-wise and <em>will</em> wear out;</li>
<li>Synthetic upper <em>will</em> tear;</li>
<li>Sizing differs between shoe lines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Good for both everyday running if you do not need anything fancy and Ok with replacing your shoe after the 500th km.</p>
