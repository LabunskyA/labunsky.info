They have all of them: road, trail, and spikes. What else does a runner need?</p> <p>That being said, there is a lot of hit or miss shoes on their shelf. With some brands, you can determine bad and good ones based on tech, stats, and basic appearance. This is not the case with Adidas. Most of their shoes are complex combinations of different technology unique to the shoe. If you have never tried one - you really could not be sure.</p> <p>But the tech itself is good. One of the best, to be honest. Propulsion plates? They have it. Expanded TPU? They invented it. Composite midsoles? Like every single shoe. Tire-level rubber on the outsoles? Continental has your back. The only downside is every single piece adding to the price tag. Not as much as Nikes, but never the less.</p> <p>Frequent clearances provide a pretty good price/quality ratio for most shoes. Just try them on before buying and avoid blind online purchases.</p> <h2>Technology</h2> <h3>Boost</h3> <p>A bit overhyped 'energy-returning' midsole. Fine for basic training and casual walking. Very soft and mushy. Despite all the claims, it returns less energy to a runner than many traditional shoes are. That's because all the return is directed upwards to your foot, not alongside the stride. That's why they are not really suitable for running. Easy miles and relaxed jogging - maybe.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Softness</th> <th>Bounce</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>TPU pellets</td> <td>Forever (?)</td> <td>Soft</td> <td>Fine</td> <td>Minimal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>LightStrike</h3> <p>A lighter EVA midsole. Basic, plain, and simple. Provides zero to no support why often used with propulsion plates.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Softness</th> <th>Bounce</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>EVA</td> <td>400 km</td> <td>Neutral</td> <td>Small</td> <td>Minimal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Boost HD</h3> <p>A refreshed version of boost. Firmer, more suitable for actual running. Same TPU pellets, but a little bit smaller, getting it a bit of a punch. Not as punchy as Reebok FloatRide Forever Energy, it stands in between. Otherwise, there is nothing special about this midsole.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Softness</th> <th>Bounce</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>TPU pellets</td> <td>Forever (?)</td> <td>Softer</td> <td>Fine</td> <td>Normal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>AlphaBounce</h3> <p>Soft foam (TPU?) caged in firm EVA (think Reebok FlashFilm). Sounds good, but the execution is off for running. It is not suitable for any serious workouts. Walking in the park? Sure! Occasionally running 6:00+/km? Maybe. Nothing more. Too firm and lack bounce (which is odd, considering the name). All the cushion is in the heel, and the forefoot strike is a burden in them.</p> <p>All of that has a good explanation tho. This midsole was designed for tennis. Yeah. And it did a great job with nice bounce and stable That's why you should not expect any performance from the shoes with it.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Softness</th> <th>Bounce</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>EVA-caged TPU</td> <td>Forever (?)</td> <td>Firmer</td> <td>Fine</td> <td>Fine</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Adidas 4D</h3> <p>3D printed premium midsole with a curve to it. Not yet tested it for running due to shoe price. Casual usage feels like a regular high-stack EVA shoes with a bit more of a punch and support.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Softness</th> <th>Bounce</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>3D-printed</td> <td>Unknown</td> <td>Firm</td> <td>Fine</td> <td>Normal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Torsion system</h3> <p>A fork-shaped plastic propulsion plate to give an additional snap and stability. Often used with LightStrike. Provides plenty of rigidity to minimal running shoes.</p> <h3>LEP - Little Extra Push</h3> <p>Smaller propulsion mechanism with a little bit of a snap.</p> <h3>Continental</h3> <p>Tire-branded rubber on the outsoles with a great grip on any asphalt-like surface;</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Softness</th> <th>Traction</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>500 km or more</td> <td>Normal</td> <td>Excellent</td> <td>Minimal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>CelerMesh</h3> <p>Very breathable, but fragile seamless mesh upper. Easily torn even with a regular load over extended running sessions or in bad weather conditions. The worst-case for mine was 100km per shoe. Not a fan. The lockdown is okay and provides plenty of support.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Lifespan</th> <th>Durability</th> <th>Breathability</th> <th>Support</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>100-500 km</td> <td>Very low</td> <td>Excellent</td> <td>Minimal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Shoes to consider</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Adizero Bekoji</strong> - spikes feel in the road shoe;</li> <li><strong>Adizero Takumi Sen</strong> - way better alternative to Adios / Boston;</li> <li><strong>PulseBoost HD</strong> - snappier than UltraBoost, great Continental outsole, under a $100.</li> </ul> <h2>The Good</h2> <ul> <li>Not a great, but good enough <em>stable</em> price/quality ratio at every price point;</li> <li>Great road and trail outsoles suitable for a wide range of weather conditions;</li> <li>Huge variety, easy to find shoes for any running style;</li> <li>Easy to find a good value on a clearance;</li> </ul> <h2>The Bad</h2> <ul> <li>Quality varies greatly between both different shoes and iterations;</li> <li>Non-Continental outsoles usually are crap;</li> <li>No technical information for most shoes in the catalog;</li> <li>Budget shoes are mediocre at the very best.</li> </ul> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Good running shoes if you know what you are going to get, but a pricey gamble otherwise.</p> </div> <div id=footer>buy me a <a href=https://ko-fi.com/labunsky>coffee</a><a></a></div> </body> </html>
