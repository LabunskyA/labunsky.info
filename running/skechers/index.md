# Skechers

Rebels, they are not like the others. Slim, cool, comfortable and cheap. Also my favorite running shoes brand.

4-6mm drop, low to high stack, any type of the upper you may wish for. The brand started as a somewhat copycat and developed a huge variety, but with a twists.

To clarify, most of my actual running shoes were made by them. Most of the early-day ones, at least. And you know, why? They are pretty much always the best option within a low budget. Hands down, not even a competition. For $50-100 you would be able to get what, Nike Downshifter? Some low-tier Adidas shoe made from a slab of generic EVA and a shitty upper? With Sheckers you would be able to get something like Go Run Pure or Pulse with decent midsole, a nice sockliner, and a really nice upper. With a tech from a previous generation, sure. But it was top of the line some day. 

Or you can even get current top of the line shoe on clearance. GoMeb Speed 6 with HyperBurst were that much for the whole autumn of 2020 on RunningWarehouse. They like good deals. You're not going to see them 24/7 like with Puma's old models, but the deals are off the charts.

But should you buy them for a full price? Some - yes. I've bought 3 pairs of GoRun Ride 7, and only the first and the last one had a discount. But the brand shines at the lower price points.
