# Nike

I do not enjoy Nike as a consumer. The problem is not in any specific shoe, no. Not even in shoes in general. They are all at least fine, easy to slip in and run on a good day or in a gym for a few miles. You can often get bleeding-edge tech with expected comfort and quality before any other manufacturer. They look good and easily can be worn as a style shoes.

But, as a high-mileage all-terrain and all-weather runner I just can't find a reason to use them. First of all - there is no versatile shoe for a person in cold regions. You just can't use most of their shoes with heavy snow - you will slip and fall more, than run. Their road shoes are totally not suitable for even light trail. The upper is thin and easily breakable. Do you know average mileage of $250 vaporflys? If not - don't ask.

For an average consumer all of that really should not matter though. That is why I would recommend it for any light running or gym use. Or on the other extreme - if you are an athlete and want a shoe to compete in. Their spikes, light speed and top-end marathon shoes are great.

**Shoes to consider:** 

- Streak - my favorite. Everything is good here, try one if you can;
- Infinity Run - good and durable everyday shoe which promotes forefoot strike;
- Pegasus Turbo - very good shoe, but way to expensive. Try looking for it on a clearance.

**Technology**:

- Zoom - EVA-based foam with pretty basic feel to it;
- ZoomX - Pebax-based foam, very springy and comfy, almost cloud-like;
- Zoom Air - pressured air bag used to distribute weight without losing both cushion and structure;
- React - combination of TPE and EVA as a compromise between weight and durability/cushioning;
- Joyride - beaded TPE (?) combined with simple EVA foam for no real life purpose;
- Flywire - old (2008+) upper material used as a durable and supportive solution in everyday shoes;
- Flyknit / AtomKnit - light knitted upper used in top shoes;
- Plates - carbon ones in top marathon (Vaporfly, Alphafly) and plastic ones in racing (Streak) shoes.

**The Good:** 

- No *really bad* shoes - every one is suitable for comfortable running experience;
- Consistent performance from shoe to shoe;
- You can try some new technologies before mass adoption.

**The Bad:** 

- Pricing is way out of touch with what competitors have for the same money; 
- Shoes are not build to last, and the pricier the shoe, the least miles you can expect from it;
- No versatility in terms of seasons or running surface.

**Verdict:** A go-to running shoe company for an average Joe with money to spare or a professional athlete.
