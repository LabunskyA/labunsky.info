# Puma

The most technological shoes out there? May as well be. If you talking about quantity, at least.

Like Adidas, they like to invent and mix things together with no particular reason, but prefer to do it in consumer-oriented shoes, not professional ones. In fact, there is no professional *running* shoes from them, if you do not count spikes. Which is actually good for us, as most of us will never run in a serious competition. And even if you want to try participating in one - you totally could do it in Pumas, just need to find a lighter model with heel drop under 12mm (yes, it is that big on some of them).

There is a clear look influence from their lifestyle shoes. More tech equals bizarre appearance with brave color palettes and decor elements. Vibrant colors and distinguished elements create very sporty and *fast* looking shoes. I was quite worried at first looking at all this after minimalist shoes from other brands and thinking: 'What a mess'. But no. Lacing is solid, upper is meshy, heels are comfy and fixating, nothing seems to be out of place.

Being a Nike subordinate the pricing is not all that good. But they have pretty much permanent -50% sale on their online shop and clearances with even lower in other shops. Even with that their shoes may seem a little bit too pricey compared to bargains from Skechers, for example. Top models still more affordable on a consistent basis.

## Technology

- **NITRO** - super-critical nitrogen-injected EVA foam (think Skechers Hyper Burst);
- **XETIC** - new EVA midsole, half-empty with MIT-calculated pattern to evenly distribute and return step energy;
- **NRGY** - Boost-like beaded TPU midsole material;
- **Ignite** - lighter TPU midsole with 34% better energy return over the usual EVA; 
- **Hybrid** - Ignite with candy-like embedded NRGY beads;
- **ProFoam** - EVA-based midsole used both as a cage and an independent midsole;
- **Proplate** - Puma's view on propulsion plates, made from plastic;
- **InnoPlate** - carbon plate with a forked design;
- **SpeedTracktion** - outsole pattern oriented on the forefoot strikers;
- **SoftFoam** - soft insole material, similar to Skechers memory foam.

## Shoes to consider

- **Deviate Nitro** - great foam and carbon plate for a reasonable price;
- **Speed 600** - caged NRGY beads with propulsion as a good daily trainer;
- **Hybrid Runner** - full neutral HYBRID midsole with nice grippy outsole.

## The Good

- Fun to try on and explore - very different shoe design to other companies;
- Very nice mid-upper durability and materials overall;
- Rather versatile - you are not limited to treadmill or asphalt;
- Consistent sizing between the models.

## The Bad 

- Little to no info on stack height, drop and what you can find is not always true;
- Lack of shoe reviews from a runners perspective;
- Initial sizing issues - you need to try it on before buying;
- Top shoes tend to be a bit too heavy for women and lighter runners.

## Verdict
Fun experiments.
