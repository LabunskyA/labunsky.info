May as well be. If you talking about quantity, at least.</p> <p>Like Adidas, they like to invent and mix things together with no particular reason, but prefer to do it in consumer-oriented shoes, not professional ones. In fact, there is no professional <em>running</em> shoes from them, if you do not count spikes. Which is actually good for us, as most of us will never run in a serious competition. And even if you want to try participating in one - you totally could do it in Pumas, just need to find a lighter model with heel drop under 12mm (yes, it is that big on some of them).</p> <p>There is a clear look influence from their lifestyle shoes. More tech equals bizarre appearance with brave color palettes and decor elements. Vibrant colors and distinguished elements create very sporty and <em>fast</em> looking shoes. I was quite worried at first looking at all this after minimalist shoes from other brands and thinking: 'What a mess'. But no. Lacing is solid, upper is meshy, heels are comfy and fixating, nothing seems to be out of place.</p> <p>Being a Nike subordinate the pricing is not all that good. But they have pretty much permanent -50% sale on their online shop and clearances with even lower in other shops. Even with that their shoes may seem a little bit too pricey compared to bargains from Skechers, for example. Top models still more affordable on a consistent basis.</p> <p><strong>Technology:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>NITRO</strong> - super-critical nitrogen-injected EVA foam (think Skechers Hyper Burst);</li> <li><strong>XETIC</strong> - new EVA midsole, half-empty with MIT-calculated pattern to evenly distribute and return step energy;</li> <li><strong>NRGY</strong> - Boost-like beaded TPU midsole material;</li> <li><strong>Ignite</strong> - lighter TPU midsole with 34% better energy return over the usual EVA; </li> <li><strong>Hybrid</strong> - Ignite with candy-like embedded NRGY beads;</li> <li><strong>ProFoam</strong> - EVA-based midsole used both as a cage and an independent midsole;</li> <li><strong>Proplate</strong> - Puma's view on propulsion plates, made from plastic;</li> <li><strong>InnoPlate</strong> - carbon plate with a forked design;</li> <li><strong>SpeedTracktion</strong> - outsole pattern oriented on the forefoot strikers;</li> <li><strong>SoftFoam</strong> - soft insole material, similar to Skechers memory foam.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Shoes to consider:</strong> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Deviate Nitro</strong> - great foam and carbon plate for a reasonable price;</li> <li><strong>Speed 600</strong> - caged NRGY beads with propulsion as a good daily trainer;</li> <li><strong>Hybrid Runner</strong> - full neutral HYBRID midsole with nice grippy outsole.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Good:</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Fun to try on and explore - very different shoe design to other companies;</li> <li>Very nice mid-upper durability and materials overall;</li> <li>Rather versatile - you are not limited to treadmill or asphalt;</li> <li>Consistent sizing between the models.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Little to no info on stack height, drop and what you can find is not always true;</li> <li>Lack of shoe reviews from a runners perspective;</li> <li>Initial sizing issues - you need to try it on before buying;</li> <li>Top shoes tend to be a bit too heavy for women and lighter runners.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Fun experiments come with price.</p> </div> <div class=footer>buy me a <a href=https://ko-fi.com/labunsky>coffee</a><a></a></div> </body> </html>
