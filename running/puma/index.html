            <h1>Puma</h1>
<p>The most technological shoes out there? May as well be. If you talking about quantity, at least.</p>
<p>Like Adidas, they like to invent and mix things together with no particular reason, but prefer to do it in consumer-oriented shoes, not professional ones. In fact, there is no professional <em>running</em> shoes from them, if you do not count spikes. Which is actually good for us, as most of us will never run in a serious competition. And even if you want to try participating in one - you totally could do it in Pumas, just need to find a lighter model with heel drop under 12mm (yes, it is that big on some of them).</p>
<p>There is a clear look influence from their lifestyle shoes. More tech equals bizarre appearance with brave color palettes and decor elements. Vibrant colors and distinguished elements create very sporty and <em>fast</em> looking shoes. I was quite worried at first looking at all this after minimalist shoes from other brands and thinking: 'What a mess'. But no. Lacing is solid, upper is meshy, heels are comfy and fixating, nothing seems to be out of place.</p>
<p>Being a Nike subordinate the pricing is not all that good. But they have pretty much permanent -50% sale on their online shop and clearances with even lower in other shops. Even with that their shoes may seem a little bit too pricey compared to bargains from Skechers, for example. Top models still more affordable on a consistent basis.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NITRO</strong> - super-critical nitrogen-injected EVA foam (think Skechers Hyper Burst);</li>
<li><strong>XETIC</strong> - new EVA midsole, half-empty with MIT-calculated pattern to evenly distribute and return step energy;</li>
<li><strong>NRGY</strong> - Boost-like beaded TPU midsole material;</li>
<li><strong>Ignite</strong> - lighter TPU midsole with 34% better energy return over the usual EVA; </li>
<li><strong>Hybrid</strong> - Ignite with candy-like embedded NRGY beads;</li>
<li><strong>ProFoam</strong> - EVA-based midsole used both as a cage and an independent midsole;</li>
<li><strong>Proplate</strong> - Puma's view on propulsion plates, made from plastic;</li>
<li><strong>InnoPlate</strong> - carbon plate with a forked design;</li>
<li><strong>SpeedTracktion</strong> - outsole pattern oriented on the forefoot strikers;</li>
<li><strong>SoftFoam</strong> - soft insole material, similar to Skechers memory foam.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shoes to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deviate Nitro</strong> - great foam and carbon plate for a reasonable price;</li>
<li><strong>Speed 600</strong> - caged NRGY beads with propulsion as a good daily trainer;</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Runner</strong> - full neutral HYBRID midsole with nice grippy outsole.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fun to try on and explore - very different shoe design to other companies;</li>
<li>Very nice mid-upper durability and materials overall;</li>
<li>Rather versatile - you are not limited to treadmill or asphalt;</li>
<li>Consistent sizing between the models.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Little to no info on stack height, drop and what you can find is not always true;</li>
<li>Lack of shoe reviews from a runners perspective;</li>
<li>Initial sizing issues - you need to try it on before buying;</li>
<li>Top shoes tend to be a bit too heavy for women and lighter runners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Fun experiments.</p>
